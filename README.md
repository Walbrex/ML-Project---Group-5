# ML-Project---Group-5

In this project, we apply Machine Learning models onto 2 different datasets in order to tackle binary classification task.

## Datasets

To this end, two datasets were considered :
  - Banknote Authentication Dataset :
 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication   (date of donwload : November 27, 2021)

  - Chronic Kidney Disease :
 
https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease   (date of donwload : November 27, 2021)


 The datasets, we used are available on this repository, respectively in the directories Banknote Authentication Dataset and Chronic Kidney Disease.

## Models

We collaboratively implemented a worflow and applied it to those two datasets.
Regarding the models, we chose to apply :
 - a K-Nearest Neighbors model (with possibility of using cross-validation for the choice of K)
 - a Random Forest model (with possibility of applying feature selection)
